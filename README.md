## Installation

- Run *npm install*

## Usage
- This project has a way for users to seach new books to read and so they can keep a list of books to purchase.
- The main point of this project was to refactor the code that was given.
- We must take a fully built application utilizing restful API's and the refactor is to be using GraphQL API build with Apollo Server. The App is built using the MERN stack with a REACT front end.
- MongoDB database and Node.js/Express.js server and API is used.
- Please note that the deployment does not fully function, I am continuing to work on editing it. It does work mostly on the local server.
